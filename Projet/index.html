  <h2>What is spotify ?</h2>

Spotify is an audio streaming platform launched by Spotify AB on 7 October 2008. It provides access to over 40 millions DRM-protected tracks and podcasts from record labels and media companies. It follows a freemium policy (basic features are available free of charge with advertisement while additional features are locked behind a subscription paywall) ; this has allowed the website to gather 207 million monthly active users, including 96 million paying subscribers (as of February 2019)." [1] </br>
As you can see on the right, it is popular in multiple countries in both Europe and America. Recently, a dataset of the stream count of the top 200 songs of Spotify per day was released. That dataset can be used to answer some questions, such as : which songs are popular in which country, and when ?

  <p>But that is not all : the data set also contains song features, which will allow us to analyze the trends between and within countries. Let us first introduce those features :</p>
