  <h2>What is spotify ?</h2>
  <div><p>
Spotify is an audio streaming platform launched by Spotify AB on 7 October 2008. </br>
It provides access to over 40 millions DRM-protected tracks and podcasts from record labels and media companies. </br> It follows a freemium policy (basic features are available free of charge with advertisement while additional features are locked behind a subscription paywall) ; </br> this has allowed the website to gather 207 million monthly active users, including 96 million paying subscribers (as of February 2019)." [1] </br></br>
As you can see below, it is popular in multiple countries in both Europe, America and Asia. </br>  Recently, a dataset of the stream count of the top 200 songs of Spotify per day in 2017 was released. That dataset can be used to answer some questions, such as : </br> which songs were popular in each country last year? The redder the country, the more Spotify is popular. Countries in black do not have access to Spotify.

  <div>But that is not all : the data set also contains song features, which will allow us to analyze the trends between and within countries. </br> Let us first introduce those features :</div>
  
  <h2>What's in a song ?</h2>
  <table><tr>
    <td style="padding-top:4%; padding-left:1%; min-width:500px;"><ul type="square">
<li><i>Danceability</i> describes how suitable a track is for dancing. </li>
<li><i>Energy</i> represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. </li>
<li><i>Instrumentalness</i> is a rating of whether the track has vocals. </li>
<li><i>Acousticness</i>  is a rating of whether the track is vocal. </li>
<li><i>Liveness</i> is a rating of whether the track is performed live. </li>
<li><i>Valence</i> describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. </li>
<li><i>Loudness</i> is the overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). </li>
<li><i>Speechiness</i> is a rating of how much of the track has vocals.  </li>
<li><i>Tempo</i> is the estimated tempo of a track. [2] </li>
    </ul></td>
    <td id="radar-chart"></td>
  </tr></table>
  
  
  <h2>How do these features evolve over the year?</h2>
  <div>The feature's intensity in a song varies according to the intensity of the green color</div>
  <div id="heatmap"></div>

  
  <h2>How are artists and genres associated with different features ?</h2>
  <div>We have seen the different features countries appreciate ; what does it mean in terms of  most streamed artists ? </br> Here are some rankings of artists by features (average of their songs) that can answer those questions :</div>
